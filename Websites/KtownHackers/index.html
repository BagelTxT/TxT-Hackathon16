Hello Los Angeles,
<br>
As one of the most populated, we also contain one of the largest stable populations (between 3000 and 6000) of homeless people in the United States in just Skid Row. Skid Row's racial make up consists of 25.5% white, 26.7% African American, .4% Native American, 5.8% Asian, 40.7% Other races, and 2% of 2 or more races. The number of men, women, and children has increased dramatically over the years. Since 2013, the percent of women in the streets has risen to 55%. The Skid row is not the only place where homeless are found,there are currently about 47,000 homeless people in and around L.A. There seems to only be engagement with the homeless from the people during holidays. So we have created a website for you to contribute to their causes fast and easy throughout all of the year not just during holiday season. Here you can register for a homeless for the walk or donate directly and the funds will be used to buy food, clothes, and daily neccesities as well as to fund homeless shelters.
